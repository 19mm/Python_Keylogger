## Simple Keyboard Event Listener (Python)
**Monitor key presses with this easy-to-use Python script!**

This Python script demonstrates basic keyboard event monitoring using the `pynput` library. It captures key presses and writes them to a text file, making it a valuable tool for:

- **Understanding user interaction patterns:** Analyze which keys users press most frequently.
- **Creating educational tutorials:** Capture keystrokes for step-by-step guides.
- **Building custom keyboard shortcuts:** Prototype custom shortcuts for your applications (with ethical considerations).

**Features:**

* Effortlessly captures key presses.
* Logs keys to a text file named "keys.txt" for easy analysis.
* Provides an optional stopping mechanism using the `End` key.

**Requirements:**

* Python 3 (download from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
* `pynput` library (install using `pip install pynput`)
